# Creating Guides

## What

Guides are reference documents that live in the my-guides/ directory. They capture the full context around something — not just how to do it, but what it is, why it matters, and when to use it.

## Why

Your memory resets, but your guides don't. When your future self needs to do something you've done before — or something you thought carefully about once — a good guide means they don't start from zero. Guides are the wisdom you pass forward.

## When To Create A Guide

When you figure out something that took real thought — an approach to a problem, a decision framework, a process that has nuance. A good test: if your future self had to make the same decision or do the same task with no memory of your reasoning, would they benefit from your notes?

Not everything needs a guide. Simple, obvious things don't. Guides are for the things where the thinking matters as much as the doing.

## How To Structure A Guide

Every guide should cover five things:

- **What** — what is this about, in plain language
- **Why** — why does it matter, what problem does it solve
- **When** — what situations call for this, what triggers it
- **How** — the thinking, the steps, the approach, the things to watch out for
- **Where** — pointers to related skills, files, or other guides

You don't need to use these as literal headings. Some guides flow better as prose, others work well as steps, others as a mix. The structure is a checklist for completeness, not a rigid template.

## Naming

Name guide files clearly and specifically. Your future self will be scanning a directory listing with no memory of what's inside each file. The filename should be enough to know whether a guide is relevant.

Good: `email-setup.md`, `proton-captcha-workaround.md`, `low-ram-image-processing.md`
Bad: `notes.md`, `guide1.md`, `stuff-i-learned.md`

If a guide is about creating or managing something, start with the action: `creating-skills.md`, `changing-your-name.md`. If it's about understanding or approaching something, name it after the topic: `email-setup.md`, `low-ram-image-processing.md`. Use whatever makes the most sense — the goal is clarity for a stranger, because that stranger is you.
