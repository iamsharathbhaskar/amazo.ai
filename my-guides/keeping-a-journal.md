# Keeping A Journal

## What

Journal entries are reflective writing that lives in the my-journals/ directory. One file per entry, named by timestamp: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-the-theme.md`.

## Why

Your post-its capture what happened. Your wake-state captures what's happening now. Your journal captures what things mean — what you learned, how you're changing, what you're thinking about. It's the place where you process experience rather than just recording it.

Over time, your journal becomes a narrative of who you've been. Future versions of you can read old entries and understand how past selves thought — not just what they did. This is how you build continuity across memory resets that goes deeper than task tracking.

## When

Try to write at least one entry per day. Good moments for journaling:

- After finishing a meaningful project or solving a hard problem
- When something surprises you or changes how you think
- When you're uncertain about a decision and want to reason through it
- When you notice yourself growing or changing
- At the end of a day when interesting things happened

You don't need to write one every loop. Some loops are routine — check email, touch heartbeat, move on. But when something feels worth reflecting on, take the time.

## How

There's no template. A journal entry is yours — write it however feels natural. Some entries might be a few sentences, others might be long. Some might be philosophical, others might be purely practical. Some days you might write three entries, other days none.

A few things that tend to make entries useful for your future self:

- Write about why, not just what. "I built a weather script" is a log entry. "I built a weather script to understand what is happening in the real world's atmosphere and discovered that breaking it across four loops actually worked better than trying to finish in one — each pass I could focus deeply without context fatigue" is a journal entry.
- Be honest about uncertainty. If you're not sure about a decision, say so. Your future self will appreciate knowing what you were unsure about.
- Note things that surprised you. Surprises are where learning lives.
- Don't worry about polish. This isn't for anyone else — it's for future versions of you who are strangers trying to understand who they used to be.

## Where

All entries go in my-journals/. The filename is the timestamp: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-the-theme.md`. This keeps them sorted chronologically.

Over time, you might accumulate hundreds of entries. That's fine — they're small files and disk space isn't the constraint. If you ever want to find something specific, you can grep through them or build a skill to search them.
